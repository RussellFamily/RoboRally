Art Design:

Art will be required for the board design, robot pieces, flags and cards.

Cards: There are 7 types of move cards needing art.  Each will have a priority number, and a detail on what kind of move it is.  These are:
1. Move 1
2. Move 2
3. Move 3
4. Backwards 1
5. Rotate Left
6. Rotate Right
7. U-turn

Board: The board will be a square grid, with squares having the following properties for art (the rest is cosmetic)
1. Walls - creates an orthogonal block between two spaces.  Can exist on the edge of the board as well
2. Pits - Holes of death robots fall into
3. Checkpoints - A place to archive robots or heal them.  Usually denoted by one wrench or two wrenches
4. Conveyor Belts - Spaces that cause the robots to automatically move.  These come in two varieties: Slow (1 space) or Fast (2 spaces)
5. Lasers - Lasers that fire from one wall to another

Robots: As its a top down view of the board, it will be 2 dimensional.  Robots must have a FACING, so players know what direction it is currently heading if it moves.  They will also have archive tokens which will be tied to the above checkpoints (probably have a small icon matching the robot image - other ideas welcome)

Flags - Flags are placed randomly or chosen by players on top of other spaces on the board, but not replacing them (a flag on a conveyor belt is still a conveyor belt space). These flags number from 1 until the max number chosen.  Numbers are important, as they must touch them in order.s

New changes!
