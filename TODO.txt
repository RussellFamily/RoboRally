TO DO LIST:

1. How to handle move actions with players who are dead or shutdown during register execution
2. Build test board and game simulation to test whether the execution of registers works - only include flags on first board.




Questions:
1. Do I build the pregame stuff in terminal interface, or do i try to create a gui outright?
	- I will select all commands from terminal, display to gui the results for first iteration
