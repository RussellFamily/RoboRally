TO DO LIST:

1. Build 5 boards from robo rally, except for parts that haven't been included as features yet
	1.Circuit Trap -> DONE
	2.Island -> DONE
	3.Cross -> DONE
	4.
	5.
2. Fix the laser image generation to show where lasers will fire
3. Fix conveyors near board edge
	1.No  longer errors out, but a dictionary location error occurred, check into that if it happens again
4. Fix checkpoint update text to break out of while loop
	->Added break statement DONE
5. Rotating Conveyor belt didn't rotate robot, check into that

  ->Looks like the print statement could be called while a robot was dead, so it broke. Removed print statement -> DONE

7. Fix shutdown protocol so that a robot who dies is continued to be shutdown for the next round -> currently robot comes back with full health not shutdown
  ->The shutdown was an equality test and not assignment, fixed issue -> DONE
